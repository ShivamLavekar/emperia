            Our journey began a century ago when we started as a textile
            production house in India. Over the years, we have grown into a
            diversified group with a presence in multiple industries and
            sectors. Empire Industries Limited, with its repertoire of
            businesses, has established a strong market presence in the
            manufacture and marketing of machine tools, industrial equipment,
            glass bottles, business centers, integrated industrial and
            residential townships, frozen foods and vending machines.  <br /><br /> Empire
            Industries Limited., through its pioneering efforts, introduced the
            internationally understood concept of vending, in India. Grabbit +
            was launched with the vision to be the most preferred vending
            solution provider by making world-class, quality vending machines
            for corporate offices in India.

                During the surge of Covid-19, individuals and communities were
                faced with the most difficult challenges. The economy was
                distraught as the supply of the most basic necessities was
                inaccessible. Grabbit+ saw this as an opportunity to contribute
                to the lives of many. Grabbit+ not only offered vending services
                during this time but also assisted institutions across the
                country in maintaining hygiene and creating a healthier, better
                and safer environment for its employees and visitors by making a
                range of health and hygiene solutions expediently available.
                This marked the beginning of the Health & Hygiene vertical,
                which is known for developing high-quality products and
                providing world-class services to its customers. Grabbit+
                started contributing to the nationâ€™s hygiene and was committed
                to serving with the same dedication and excellence that have
                been our hallmark for a hundred years.
