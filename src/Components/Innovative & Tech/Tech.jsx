                Recently, the world has faced the COVID-19 pandemic situation,
                which has taught the importance of hygiene solutions. This
                encouraged us to provide effective and innovative hygiene care
                solutions that ultimately contribute to promote healthy living.
                Based on various studies, surfactant plays a vital role in all
                cleaning formulations. Moreover, its structure and properties
                provide a greater opportunity for smart modifications.
                Therefore, Empire Industries Limited utilizes “SMART MICELLAR
                TECHNOLOGY” in all cleaning ranges of products with the brand
                name “EMPERIA 1900″. <br /><br /> The technology is enabled by smart action
                techniques for cleaning surfaces. This technology employs a
                technically designed surfactant that works on the fundamental
                principle of “like attracts like”. This suggests that the polar
                head group is water-loving and the long hydrophobic hydrocarbon
                tail is water-repelling. This techno-enabled surfactant is smart
                enough for all types of stains, dirt and soil.

            In order to understand Smart Micellar Technology, we should first
            understand surfactant, factors affecting cleaning such as surface
            tension, Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance, and the essential need for
            cleaning, as highlighted below.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h5 className="headline fw-bold">Surfactants</h5>
          <p>
            Surfactants are the primary components of cleaning detergents.
            Surfactants are also called surface active agents that are
            amphiphilic in nature, i.e. dual-natured molecules. The general
            structure possesses a polar group that is “water-loving” and called
            a “hydrophilic head” and another non-polar group that is
            “water-repelling” (or oil loving) which is denoted as a “hydrophobic
            tail”. Generally, the polar head group is composed of
            anionic/cationic or non-ionic charge molecules and a long chain of
            hydrocarbons denoted as the tail of the surfactant, which is the
            hydrophobic part of the surfactant. Surfactants are used as a key
            component in many of the diverse industrial products or in their
            processes. Due to their dual nature, they are helpful in decreasing
            the interfacial tension (also called surface tension) between two
            phases.

          <h2>Factors Affecting Cleaning:</h2>
          <h5 className="headline fw-bold">Surface Tension</h5>
          <p>
            The water molecule consists of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Due to the
            difference in their electronegativity, the hydrogen atoms are
            polarized toward the oxygen atom. This causes the development of a
            charge on the water molecule. These charges may vary from bulk water
            molecules to those present on the top layer. The bulk water
            molecules are surrounded by other water molecules, which stabilize
            their charge. However, the surface water molecules are in an
            unstable position as they hang between the liquid and air medium and
            therefore, these unstabilized dangling molecules react to achieve
            stability faster. Therefore when any molecule touches the surface,
            the unstable water molecule attracts the material thereby lowering
            the surface tension of the water molecule. This way it plays a vital
            role in dissolving the dirt.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h5 className="headline fw-bold">Hydrophilic - Lipophilic Balance</h5>
          <p>
            The Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance (HLB) scale is a standard scale
            used to measure the hydrophilic to lipophilic balance ratio. The HLB
            value is significantly important in dissolving the dirt and prevents
            its redeposition.

          <h5 className="headline fw-bold">Micellar Formation and Cleaning Action</h5>
          <p>
            The characteristic nature of soil particles varies from water-loving
            (hydrophilic) to oil loving (liophilic). Based on the nature of soil
            particles and surrounds the soil by the accumulation of the
            surfactant’s tail in the soil, which leads to the formation of a
            spherical structure known as a micelle structure. The micelle
            structure aligns the head group in such a way that they are exposed
            to the water while the tail part is away from the water. The micelle
            encloses the soil particle and appears in a spherical form, which
            minimizes the contact of the soil with the surface. Finally, with
            ample water washing, the micelles burst into fine particles and the
            soil particle disintegrates into very small fine particles, which
            can easily be washed away.
